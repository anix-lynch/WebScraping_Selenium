# 🕸️ WebScrapePy: Web Scraping Using Selenium in Python

Welcome to **WebScrapePy**! In this project, we’ll learn how to scrape data from websites using **Selenium** in Python. We’ll fetch data in the form of HTML elements from Wikipedia and automate webpage interactions. We’ll also clean the scraped text using **regex** and organize it into **Python dictionaries**. Let’s explore web scraping and automation with Selenium! 🌐🤖

## 🌐 Project Overview

Web scraping allows us to extract data from websites, and **Selenium** provides tools to automate this process efficiently. In this project, we’ll focus on scraping data from Wikipedia using Selenium’s powerful commands. We’ll interact with HTML elements like CSS class names, IDs, and tags, automate events like clicking links and navigating pages, and clean the scraped data using **regex**. Finally, we’ll organize the cleaned data into Python dictionaries for easy access and further analysis.
